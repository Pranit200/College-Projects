# Statistical Analysis of Maternal Mortality Rate
1. Comparison of changes in IMR,MMR and Literacy Rates from 2011 to 2018.
2. Firstly we check CORRELATION between the factors affecting MMR.
3. Used ONE SAMPLE RUN TEST to check randomness of data.
4. Used SHAPIRO TEST to check normality of data
5. Used t-test to check equality of two sample means.
6. Compared changes in IMR, MMR and Literacy rates from 2011 to 2018 using paired t-test.
7. Studied quantitative relationship between the variables using Simple linear regression.

   
# Predictive Analysis of Income using various Attribute
1. Performed Data Cleaning operations like handeling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Done Univariate and Bivariate Analysis of the Attributes.
3. Applied various machine learning algorithms and based on AUC value and accuracy, we came to conclusion that Adaboost was the best model for fitting the data.
4. Extracted important features which has significant impact on an individual income level.
